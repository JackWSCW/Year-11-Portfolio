<h2 class="lefttext">OVERVIEW</h2>


<div class="split-box">
<p class="bodytext child-box">On the right is the first stage of my low poly character, 
    where I created a two point turn around for the outline of my character, 
    which I will later use as a reference.</p>

<h2 class="lefttext">Testing</h2>

<p class="bodytext">I think that the proportions, and muscular proportions of my 
    turnaorund is good, and mosly realistic. However next time I think I could 
    improve on aligning the two angle's, and making them more similar in 
    proportions and sizing relative to the other angle.

<h2 class="lefttext">Feedback</h2>

<h3 class="que">What do you like about my character turnaround?</h3>

<p class="bodytext">Person 1: I like the smooth drawing, good scale, side view and front view work together.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Person 2: </p>

<h3 class="que">What could I improve about my character turn around 
    considering that it's supposed to be a tall muscular male?</h3>

<p class="bodytext">Person 1: You could make the hands bigger to fit the arms, so its more proportionate.</p>
