<h2 class="lefttext">OVERVIEW</h2>


<div class="split-box">
<p class="bodytext child-box">On the right is the first stage of my low poly character, 
    where I created a two point turn around for the outline of my character, 
    which I will later use as a reference.</p>

</div>

<h2 class="lefttext">Testing</h2>

<p class="bodytext">I think that the proportions, and muscular proportions of my 
    turnaorund is good, and mosly realistic. However next time I think I could 
    improve on aligning the two angle's, and making them more similar in 
    proportions and sizing relative to the other angle. 
</p>

<h2 class="lefttext">Feedback</h2>

<h3 class="que">What do you like about my character turnaround?</h3>

<p class="bodytext">Person 1: I like the smooth drawing, good scale, side view and front view work together.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Person 2: I like that you have focused on certain muscles and made sure to include them. </p>

<h3 class="que">What could I improve about my character turn around 
    considering that it's supposed to be a tall muscular male?</h3>

<p class="bodytext">Person 1: You could make the hands bigger to fit the arms, so its more proportionate.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Person 2: Apart from making sure both angles are matching up well and that the hands are proportionate
    and accurate, I don't think there is much else to be improved upon.
</p> 

<h3 class="que">Improvements</h3>
<p class="bodytext">*Nothing changed</p>

<h2 class="lefttext">Arms</h2>

<h2 class="lefttext">OVERVIEW</h2>


<div class="split-box">
<p class="bodytext child-box">To the right is the arms of my low poly character, one of the very first body parts 
    implemented into the actual design. </p>

</div>

<h2 class="lefttext">Testing</h2>

<p class="bodytext">Looking at my arms I think that they are overall alright, however I think that they could do with
    some more cuts, especially around the top shoulder area.</p>

<h2 class="lefttext">Feedback</h2>

<h3 class="que">What do you like about my characters arms?</h3>

<p class="bodytext">Person 1: I like the size and muscular definition.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Person 2: I think that the proportions are good with the upper arm and forearm.</p>

<h3 class="que">What could I improve on when it comes to the detail of my characters arms?</h3>

<p class="bodytext">Person 1: You could make the hand more detailed and larger to match the rest of the arm.</p>

<p class="bodytext">Person 2: I think that the upper arm could do with a lot more cuts to make the detail better.
</p> 

<h3 class="que">Improvements</h3>
<p class="bodytext">To the right is a new and improved image of my low poly characters arm, I added more cuts
     to the arms in places to make it less blocky and more defined.</p>
