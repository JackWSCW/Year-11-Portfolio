 <h1 class="lefttext">Low Poly Character</h1>


<h2 class="lefttext">OVERVIEW</h2>



<p class="bodytext">The following project shows the 3D low poly character that I created in the program blender. I chose to create a tall male character with a muscular frame, and make both an idle and running animation for him.</p>

   

<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>

<hr class="rounded">

<h2 class="lefttext">END USERS</h2>
<p class="bodytext">My end users are teenagers 13-18 years old who like rapid action/adventure/ fighting games. 
  The character will have details the same as humans so that the user feels like they are the warrior themselves 
  running through the enviroment in the game, the aim is to make it feel realistic. To further acheive this I will
include animations similar to real life like realistic fighting moves, and effects, as my end user will likely be looking for effects like this.
</p>

    <hr class="rounded">

    <h2 class="lefttext">REQUIREMENTS</h2>
   <li>Head</li> 
   <p class="bodytext">The head has to be a realistic shape, meaning round, and a sharp jaw line as it is a muscular character.</p> 
   <li>Arms</li>
   <p class="bodytext">Arms have to be somewhat large, and include muscles such as the biceps and triceps, as well as large shoulders. The character also have to have moving elbows when it does specific movements.</p>
   <li>Legs</li>
   <p class="bodytext">The legs have to be bigger than the average human, meaning muscles like the qauds, and calfs have to be clearly developed on the character. The character also has to have bending knees when it moves for the realism factor.</p>
   <li>Torso/Chest</li>
   <p class="bodytext">The wasit on the character has to be slimmer, and abs will be present, above that the pectorial muscles will be large and wider then the waist, as well as stick out further in the front then the stomach, this is to involve masculine traits present in real life, especially refuring to warriors in history.</p>
   <li>Muscles</li>
   <p class="bodytext">Throughout the whole character main muscles groups have to be visible and obviously present.</p>
   <li>Height and General Size</li>
   <p class="bodytext">The character has to be on the taller side, and have a larger frame.</p>
   <li>Facial hair</li>

        <h2 class="lefttext">IMPLICATIONS</h2>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
<p class="smallertext">
Aesthetics - Functionality - Usability - Intellectual Property</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="h3head">Aesthetics</h3>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p class="bodytext">Aesthetics is about how something looks and feels.
    This is important for my low-poly character because how it looks could be the
    factor that makes people want to play the game, or not. The movement of the character
    is also very important because it needs to feel good for people to want to keep playing.
 </p>

<p class="titles2">I will address this by:</p>

<li class="list2">Making as many parts of the character as smooth as possible so that it is more
realistic instead of having a bunch of blocks stuck together</li>
<br>
    <li class="list2">Using relevent colours to give the character more detail and to better develop the theme and who
        the character is supposed to be</li>
<br>
        <li class="list2">Making running and moving animations at a human-like speed, not too fast, and not too slow, and within a life-like range
            of motion to keep the realism</li>
<br>

<h3 class="h3head">Functionality</h3>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p class="bodytext">
Funcionality is about whether something works how its supposed to or not. This is important for my 
low-poly character because if it doesn't function properly, then people will not 
want to play, or they will have a bad experience doing so.
</p>

<p class="titles2">I will address this by:</p>

<li class="list2">Running multiple checks along the way and analysing whether certain controls work, and move joints like
    the arms, and legs properly when in motion, meaning they not expend to far
</li>
<br>
    <li class="list2"></li>
<br>
        <li class="list2"></li>
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="h3head">Usability</h3>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p class="bodytext">Usability is about how well you can use something, and the experiance when doing so.
    This is important for my low-poly character because how somthing works, and how easy it is to control it,
    is directly correlated to the users experience playing the game, and understanding the controls.
 </p>


<p class="titles2">I will address this by:</p>

<li class="list2">Testing the controls to make sure each key sends the character in the right direction</li>
<br>
    <li class="list2">Test the delay between pressing a key and the character moving, to make sure that the delay is not too long</li>
<br>
        <li class="list2"></li>
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="h3head">Intellectual Property</h3>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p class="bodytext">Intellectual property is about creations of our own mind, and what is ours, and ours only.</p>
