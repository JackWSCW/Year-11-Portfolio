 <h1 class="lefttext">Text Adventure Game</h1>
<br>

<h2 class="lefttext">OVERVIEW</h2>



<p class="bodytext">In the following project me and two others made a text adventure game set on a isolated island which involves you choosing the right options to survive until help comes and you win the game. However not all options selections have an effect on your life in the game but the path it takes you down might.  </p>

<hr class="rounded">

<h2 class="lefttext">END USERS</h2>
<p class="bodytext"> Our end users for this game is kids/teenagers 7 - 18 years old, with a 7+ age restriction. This game is targeted at people
    who like survival and adventure games, and the story that comes long with it.
</p>

    <hr class="rounded">

    <h2 class="lefttext">REQUIREMENTS</h2>
    <li>Start and End aka Win/ Lose</li> 
   <p class="bodytext">The game obviously needs to start, and will also have an ending at some point. This also 
    includes winning and losing, if you make it to the end of the game you will win, and that is the only way to
     win. However it is also possible to lose, this would resault in the game ending before you actually finish
      the whole story. </p> 
   <li>Descision Making</li>
   <p class="bodytext">This game needs to include points where there is a situation, and you, the player, has to 
    choose one of multiple options to continue. These options also need to resualt in a score being noted
     down, either subtracting or adding points to your life. It is also required for these options to not 
     be obviously right or wrong, in some cases there will be multiple options which will maintain your 
     health points and not subtract, but these options are based on common sense and and survival
      knoledge, so it will not be something like "Drink the water to survive", or "don't drink the water and die".</p>
   <li>Storyline</li>
   <p class="bodytext">This game is built on the story that plays in between option selects and changes depending on
     what options you decide to choose. This means there needs to be print functions with explanations and 
    descriptions of what is going on.</p>

        <h2 class="lefttext">IMPLICATIONS</h2>
         <br>
         <br>
         <br>
<p class="smallertext">
  Functionality - Usability - Future-Proofing </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3 class="h3head">Functionality</h3>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p class="bodytext">
 Functionality is whether something works how it is supposed to or not. It is very important to this game as if it does not function perfectly it could firsly just not work, 
 but also might not make sense if certain options you choose take you to the wrong part of the strong depending on
 what you chose. Aside from that there will also be a point system in place which needs to work proparly in order 
 for you to be able to potentially die, and survive. 
</p>

<p class="titles2">I addressed this by:</p>

<li class="list2">Making sure the option select screens work and show all of the options</li>
<br>
    <li class="list2">Making sure options selected take you to the right part of the story.</li>
<br>
        <li class="list2">Making sure the point system stores and collects data correctly, as well 
            as putting out the right outputs if a player looses all of their lives.</li>
<br>

<h3 class="h3head">Usability</h3>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p class="bodytext">
 Usability is about if something is easy to use or not, and the experiance when doing so. In this case it means 
 selecting options is easy to understand and do.
</p>

<p class="titles2">I addressed this by:</p>

<li class="list2">Implementing a number or letter select system instead of having to input the whole answer.</li>
<br>
    <li class="list2">Incuding proper instructions at the beginning so the player knows how the game works and 
        what they are supposed to do.</li>
<br>
        <li class="list2">There are multiple parts of the game which will benifit from a pause when code is 
            being printed, this will be used to add effect, and help the user absorb the information. For this
             we will have to make sure that it pauses for the right amount of time so that the user doesn't
              think it broken if it stops for too long. </li>
<br>
<br>

<h3 class="h3head">Future-Proofing</h3>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p class="bodytext">
 Future-Proofing is about making sure that what you make now can be easily understood, and adjustable 
 according to future events that my take place. In this case future-proofing is important so that in the future if we 
 want to make changes to our games code, we can, and it will be somewhat easy to do so. 
</p>

<p class="titles2">I addressed this by:</p>

<li class="list2">Adding comments using the # function to give titles to what the below area is about.</li>
<br>
    <li class="list2">Correctly name version changes so that in the future if we need to go back and fix something
        it is easy to find.
    </li>
<br>
        <li class="list2">Implementing more loops so that the code is more simple and changes are easier and faster.</li>
